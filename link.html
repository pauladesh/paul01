    healthy behaviour to stop new infections.
    The Centre’s lockdown is the most rigorous globally,
    but it has witnessed severe gaps in implementation.
    Although the Home Ministry’s original 21-day order and subsequent

    has resulted in distressing instances of arbitrary and often violent policing.
